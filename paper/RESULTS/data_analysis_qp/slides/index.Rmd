# Palma

* Capital city of the Balearic Islands.

* Biggest city in Mallorca.

* 1.2 M inhabitants (INE, 2024):

  + 80% live in Mallorca.

    + 40% live in Palma.
    
* A "melting pot" (Blas-Arroyo, 2007).
    
* Languages: Catalan and Spanish.

# Linguistic situation in the Balearic Islands

* Catalan and Spanish have coexisted since the **16th century**.

* There have been attempts from former governments to **reduce** the presence of Catalan (e.g., Franco’s Dictatorship, 1939-1975).

* In the 1970s and 1980s, a legal framework was developed in the Balearic Islands to normalize and promote Catalan.

  + *Spanish Constitution* (1978).
  
  + *Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands* (1983).
  
  + *Linguistic Normalization of the Balearic Islands Act* (1986).

* Since then, the general knowledge of Catalan has **increased** considerably.

* The establishment of this legal framework, and the implementation of certain language policies, seem to have been accompanied by a process of **polarization** in terms of language attitudes.

---

# Language attitudes and language policy

* Policy and planning should be intended to change language attitudes (O'Rourke & Hogan-Brun, 2012).

* Language policy can influence language attitudes (Marley, 2004) **&rarr;** Language attitudes toward Portuguese in Uruguay in the 19th century (Bertolotti & Coll, 2020).
  
* Language attitudes can influence language policy (Errihani, 2008; Mukhuba, 2005) **&rarr;** Language attitudes toward Papiamentu in Curaçao (Kester, 2020)
  
* This relationship has also been explored in regions where Catalan and Spanish coexist from many different perspectives (mainly Catalonia):

  + **Education** (Huguet, 2001; Huguet & Suïls, 1997; Janés et al., 2008).

  + **Immigration and ethnic origin** (Estors Sastre, 2014; Iglesias, 2010).
 
  + **Age** (Joan i Marí, 2010; Ubalde, 2013).
  
  + **Family** (Huguet, 2005)

# What about the Balearic Islands?
  
* **Place of residence** (Calafat-Vila & Calero-Pons, 2019).

* **Mother tongue** (Aguiló-Mora & Lynch, 2017; Calafat-Vila & Calero-Pons, 2019; Ibáñez-Ferreté, 2014; Tudela Isanta, 2021).

* **Age** (Aguiló-Mora & Lynch, 2017; Castell et al., 2023).

* **Identity** (Calafat-Vila & Calero-Pons, 2019; Ibáñez-Ferreté, 2014; Tudela Isanta, 2021).

* **Political orientation** (Aguiló-Mora & Lynch, 2017; Castell et al., 2023; Ibáñez-Ferreté, 2014).

  + Especially in recent years **&rarr;** **Ongoing political debate** (Amorós, 2017; Colmenero, 2018; Colom, 2023; Crespí, 2023; Galvín, 2017; Garau, 2023; Gentili, 2013; Manresa, 2015; Mateos, 2023; Olaizola, 2013; Pellicer, 2023; Sánchez, 2023).

# The present study

* **GOAL**: to further explore the relationship between language attitudes and political orientation in Palma.

* **PURPOSE**: to examine whether political orientation is a significant predictor of the language attitudes of Palma’s population toward Catalan and Spanish.

* Why Palma?

  + It concentrates 40% of the archipelago’s population (INE, 2024)

  + It is the most diverse city – “melting pot” (Blas-Arroyo, 2007)

  + Lower social contact with Catalan (Calafat Vila & Calero-Pons (2019)

# Research Questions

<br>

  **RQ1**: Is political orientation a significant predictor of the language attitudes toward Catalan and Spanish in Palma?

<br>

<br>

  **RQ2**: What is the relationship between different political orientations and language attitudes of the population of Palma toward Catalan and Spanish?

---

# Method

*Materials*

* Online survey hosted on Qualtrics. Three parts:

  + **First**: Demographic questionnaire (gender, age, ethnic origin, SES, and political orientation).
  
  + **Second**: Language use questionnaire (knowledge of Catalan and Spanish, mother tongue, other languages studied, and language used with different social groups and in different social contexts.
  
  + **Third**: Language attitudes questionnaire. Two types of questions:
  
      + Incomplete sentences (e.g., "the official language of the Balearic Islands should be...").
    
      + 60 evaluative statements (e.g., "I like it when people use Spanish") **&rarr;** followed by a 100-point draggable sliding scale.
      
          + Related to specific topics and ongoing discourses surrounding Catalan and Spanish in the Balearic context.

---

# Method

*Procedure*

* Participants self-identified for this study. Requirements:

  + To be over 18 years old.

  + To live in Palma or to have lived in Palma for 5 years.

  + To have knowledge of Catalan and Spanish.

+ Survey shared using social networks and other communication channels.

* Participants completed the survey on their own electronic devices, at their own pace, and without being observed.

* It took 15 minutes.

* Participants were paid 10€

# Method

*Participants*

* 127 responses were collected (28 were discarded). TOTAL: 99.

* Data collection took place during a ten-day period during the Fall 2023 semester.

# Discussion

**RQ1**: Is political orientation a significant predictor of the language attitudes toward Catalan and Spanish in Palma?

  + Yes! This helps us understand:
  
    + The political motivations for current languages policies in the Balearic Islands.
    
    + The views and reactions of the population toward the policies and their implementation.

**RQ2**: What is the relationship between different political orientations and language attitudes of the population of Palma toward Catalan and Spanish?
  
  * There are clear political divisions with regard to language attitudes.
    
  * Differing attitudes towards Catalan and Spanish reflect their social and cultural positions in the community.
    
  * Individuals language attitudes need not always align with usage patterns.

* First finding:

  + Clear division between progressive and conservative participants in terms of language attitudes (Ibáñez Ferreté, 2014).
  
      + **Progressive participants**: positive language attitudes toward both Catalan and Spanish (bilingualism), with a stronger preference for Catalan. Possible explanations:
      
          + Mother tongue (Aguiló-Mora & Lynch, 2017; Calafat Vila & Calero-Pons, 2019; Ibáñez Ferreté, 2014; Tudela Isanta, 2021).
        
          + Identity (Ibáñez Ferreté, 2014).
    
      + **Conservative participants**: positive attitudes toward Spanish and comparatively less positive attitudes toward Catalan.
    
  + These findings reflect the current political debate in the Balearic Islands regarding the status and the presence that each language should have both at a societal and political level.

# Disussion

* Second finding:

  + Results follow the framework of **authentic** versus **anonymous** laid out by Woolard (2001).
  
      + **Authentic**: language or linguistic variety defined as one that is related to an identity, an emotional dimension, and a particular community.
    
      + **Anonymous**: language or linguistic variety not related to a specific identity aspect and is normally the hegemonic one in the public sphere and, therefore, become a **neutral** language.
    
  + In the context of the Balearic Islands:
  
      + Authentic language: **Catalan** (strong language attitudes - identity element).
    
      + Anonymous language: **Spanish** (neutral language attitudes - communication element).

# Disussion

* Third finding:

  + Two trends not identified by prior studies:
  
      + **Centrists**: there is a difference in terms of **language attitudes** and **language uses**.
      
          + Possible explanation: Catalan as their L1.
        
              + Need to distinguish more clearly between language attitudes and language uses.
          
      + **Center-left**: neutrality
      
          + As political orientation moves toward the center, language attitudes become more neutral and less extreme, with language attitudes essentially becoming less tied to political orientation. 
        
          + As political orientation becomes more extreme, either to the left or to the right, attitudes toward one’s own languages become more polarized and no longer neutral.
